        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>
          So my favorite thing in the world to do is cook. I own every kitchen
          gadget known to man. It's super relaxing and dinner time has become
          sacred in my house.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started cooking because I loved to eat, and I started really
          experiencing around my mid-20's. I'll cook the same thing a thousand
          times if that's what it takes to get it right.
        </p>
        <h3>Three things I love to cook:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Steak</li>
          <li>Oxtail</li>
          <li>Raw Tuna</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hairstyling</h2>
        <p>
          I liked doing my hair, every new style channeled a new me. Doing hair
          as a side hustle is cool too; I can gab and gossip with my clients,
          and make some money at the same time. Win-win.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned how to braid when I was 12, and I would practice on myself
          and my sister and my dolls. In college and while in the army I would
          do hair for money here and there. Three months before the pandemic, I
          went to a stylist to get my hair done and I left her home with the
          flu. I started taking clients during the pandemic and soon after, I
          made it an official business.
