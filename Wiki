      <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <p>
        So my favorite thing in the world to do is cook. It's relaxing and
        dinner time has become sacred in my house. I started cooking because I
        loved to eat, and I started really experiencing around my mid-20's. I'll
        cook the same thing a thousand times if that's what it takes to get it
        right.
      </p>
      <h3>Three things I love to cook:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Oxtail</li>
        <li>Raw Tuna</li>
      </ul>
